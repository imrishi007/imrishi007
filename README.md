# Hi, I’m Rishi

Quant-inclined Computer Science student with a strong focus on **algorithmic problem solving**,  
**mathematical intuition**, and **core CS fundamentals**.

I’m drawn to intellectually hard problems and prefer depth over surface-level engineering.
I enjoy reasoning-heavy work and exploring ideas that sit slightly off the mainstream path.
