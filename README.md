# Hi, I'm Rishi 👋

### Algorithms • Computational Thinking • Writing

I'm a Computer Science student who enjoys **problem-solving**, **mathematical intuition**, and explaining complex ideas in simple words.  
My main interests are **DSA**, **core CS concepts**, and the early foundations of **quantitative finance**.

I'm not focused on software development — I prefer building things only when they feel intellectually meaningful.
